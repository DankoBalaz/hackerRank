# HackerRank Daily Challenges Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the daily challenges on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). Each solution is self-contained in its own directory, which includes the problem statement, the solution code, and a brief write-up explaining the solution.

## Structure

- Each directory is named after the challenge.
- Inside each directory:
    - `<task-name>.*`: The solution code.
    - `Problem.md`: A brief explanation of the problem.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the challenge you're interested in.
3. Read the `Problem.md` file to understand the challenge.
4. Explore the `Solution.*` file to see my solution to the challenge.
