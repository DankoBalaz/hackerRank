# HackerRank Daily Challenges Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the daily challenges on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). Each solution is self-contained in its own directory, which includes the problem statement, the solution code, and a brief write-up explaining the solution.

## Structure

- Each directory is named after the challenge.
- Inside each directory:
    - `Problem.md`: The problem statement.
    - `Solution.*`: The solution code, where `*` is the file extension for the programming language (e.g., `Solution.py` for Python, `Solution.cpp` for C++, etc.).
    - `README.md`: A brief explanation of the solution, including the approach taken and any interesting observations or lessons learned.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the challenge you're interested in.
3. Read the `Problem.md` file to understand the challenge.
4. Explore the `Solution.*` file to see my solution to the challenge.
5. Optionally, read the `README.md` file in the challenge directory for an explanation of the solution.
